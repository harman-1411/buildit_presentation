First of all, congratulations on forking this repository! 🎉
You’ve just taken your first step into the world of open-source contribution — well done!

Let me tell you something: working with any tech stack or in any domain isn’t as difficult as it seems. 
All it really takes is a bit of time, consistency, and the willingness to learn. Once you start exploring, 
things begin to make sense on their own.

So, let’s get started! 🚀

Secondly, we won’t be providing a direct method to update the pitch deck website. 
However, everything you need to understand the project is clearly mentioned in the README.md.
Make sure you go through it carefully before proceeding.

All the best — and remember,

Let’s BuildIt! 🔥
